    <h3>Why donate?</h3>
    <div class="pad donation_info">
        <p>{{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} has no advertisements, is not sponsored, and provides its services
        free of charge. For these reasons, {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s financial obligations can only
        be met with the help of voluntary user donations. Supporting {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} is and
        will always remain voluntary. If you are financially able, help pay {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s
        bills by donating. {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s survival is up to you.</p>

        <p>{{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} uses all voluntary donations to cover the costs of running the site,
        tracker, email, and IRC network. These costs represent the hardware the site runs on (e.g. servers,
        upgrades, fixes, etc.), and recurring operating expenses (e.g. hosting, bandwidth, power, etc.).</p>

        <p>Please note that {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} is a nonprofit organization. No staff member or
        other individual responsible for the site's operation personally profits from user donations. As a
        donor, your financial support is exclusively applied to operating costs. When you donate you aren't
        paying the {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} Staff, purchasing upload credit, or buying the ability to
        download. When you donate you are paying {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s bills. </p>

        <p>{{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s Donor Rank system is currently available to all credited donors.
        This system provides donors with perks. Some of these perks are cosmetic (e.g. a donor icon added
        to your account), some are one-time benefits (e.g. additional invites), and others modify specific
        site options (e.g. additional profile information boxes).</p>

        Be reminded that when you make a donation, you aren't "purchasing" Donor Ranks, invites, or any
        {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}-specific benefit. When donating, you are helping {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}
        pay its bills, and your donation should be made in this spirit. The {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }} Staff
        does its best to recognize {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}'s financial supporters in a fair and fun way,
        but all Donor Perks are subject to change or cancellation at any time, without notice.
